<system name="flaps">

 <documentation>
  The flap control system consists of a
  - power switch
    - TBD
  - an operating switch (values -1.0/IN, 0.0/STOP, 1.0/OUT)
    - fcs/flap-motor-cmd-norm

  "The flaps on standard S. 23 'boats were moved by a single small
  electric motor, which took a full minute to wind them out to the
  full flap position of 25 deg. and a minute and a half to retract
  them." ([Cassidy:2004:FE], pp.30)

  "The Captain called the flap setting and the First Officer reached
  up to pull the flap motor switch - BLUE light ON - and moved the
  controller flaps operating switch down to FLAPS OUT. As the flaps
  start to move, he confirmed "Flaps going OUT, Sir" while watching
  the flap position indicator move round the dial - the RED light
  coming ON as the flaps moved past the 1/3 OUT position. Flap
  settings were 1/2 3/4 and FULL for heavy swell conditions with a
  maximum speed of 102 knots (188 km .per hr.) for FULL flap."
  ([Cassidy:2004:FE], pp.170)
